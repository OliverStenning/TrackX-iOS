  "details": "SpaceX's primary west coast launch pad for polar orbits and sun-synchronous orbits, primarily used for Iridium NEXT and scientific satellite launches. The pad was used for the debut of Falcon 9 v1.1 in the rocket's first ever non-dragon mission, CASSIOPE, in September 2013. It is SpaceX's only remaining pad with the old-style transporter/erector, which reclines prior to launch instead of using a throwback procedure. It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).",
