SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.",
